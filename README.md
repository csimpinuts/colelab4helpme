Lab 4. please help me.

So far, my only problems have been providing the correct information to actually log in. Another problem which I still haven't found a solution to is my inability to push changes from my local clone to the main repository.

Second update. Note: I forgot to commit for this milestone. My problems here were caused by some unknown force. I was working on the display for the time frames of stats you can see and the page just wouldnt load. I just Ctrl Z'ed my way back to a version where it did work and tried a different way to have my little play buttons. I will say I did have a bit of help from my buddy chat, especially with the areas im not familiar with or haven't touched in a while like html and java.

Some more problems ive faced is my desire to get a currently playing song display that updates when any of the buttons are pressed. These problems are more associated with trying to get the look of the program to be what i want it to be. At this point i think i've utilized the api in the ways i would like.
